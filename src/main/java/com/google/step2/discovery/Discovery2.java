/**
 * Implements Next-Generation OpenID discovery, based on Link-headers,
 * link-elements, and host-meta. There are two different discovery
 * operations available:
 *
 * (1) discover the OP endpoint(s) for a "site", and
 * (2) discover the OP endpoint(s) for an OpenID (aka claimed id, which is the
 *     id of a user)
 *
 * Case (1) is for when users merely indicate the IdP to the RP, case (2) is
 * for when users actually submit their OpenID (claimed id) to the RP, and also
 * used during the validation of an authentication response from an IdP.
 *
 * The strategy for case (1) is as follows:
 *
 * - find the host-meta file for the site.
 * - find a link in the host-meta that points to an XRD(S) metadata
 *   document for the site
 * - follow the links in the XRD(S) to find the OP endpoint.
 *
 * The strategy for case (2) is as follows:
 *
 * - Try host-meta strategy (2a)
 * - If that fails, link-header strategy (2b)
 * - If that fails, try link-element strategy (2c)
 *
 * Strategy (2a) works as follows:
 *
 * - find the host-meta file for the host identified in the claimed id.
 * - in the host-meta file, check whether a Link-Pattern in the host-meta
 *   points to an XRD(S) for the claimed id, and if so, skip the next two steps.
 * - if not, find a Link in the host-meta that points to an XRD(S) metadata
 *   document for the site.
 * - follow the URITemplate link in the site XRD(S) to find the XRD(S) for the
 *   the claimed id.
 * - follow the links in the XRD(S) to find the OP endpoint.
 *
 * Strategy (2b) works as follow:
 *
 * - Find a link in the HTTP headers in the HTTP response that points
 *   to an XRD(S) metadata document for the claimed id.
 * - follow the links in the XRD(S) to find the OP endpoint.
 *
 * Strategy (2c) works as follow:
 *
 * - Find an HTML link element in the document returned from
 *   the claimed id that points to an XRD(S) metadata document for the
 *   claimed id.
 * - follow the links in the XRD(S) to find the OP endpoint.
 *
 *
 * For backwards compatibility, we also provide a generic discover() method,
 * which decides whether to use site-discovery or user-id-discovery based on the
 * type of the provided identifier. This allows us to use this class inside the
 * openid4java library.
 *
 * When calling this class through the legacy generic discover() method, we also
 * employ a "fallback" strategy, i.e. we first try the strategy described above,
 * and then fall back to OpenID 2.0-style discovery, if the strategy above
 * doesn't yield any results.
